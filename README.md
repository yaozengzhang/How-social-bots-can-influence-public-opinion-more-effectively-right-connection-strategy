The main program for one study

All code is based on matlab

We also provide fig8, 11, 12 tif type images in the folder for reading more data results.

you shold:

1.run BA_network_1_to_6.mat to load the BA networks data and then run Figure6_six_BA_network_guide_effect.m to get the result of Fig.6

    You can get the data result which we use in our work of Fig.6

  Figure6_six_BA_network_guide_effect.m has been commented in English to make it easier for readers to understand the program.

    The main functionality implemented in this program is the primary model constructed for our work.

2.run WS_network_24.mat to load the WS networks data and then run Figure9_WS_network_guide_effect.m to get the result of Fig.9

    You can get the data result which we use in our work of Fig.9
